# Comparison Operator
# Compare value and return Boolean and True and False

# Greater than
# x = 10
# y = 3
# print(x > y) Out True

# Less than
# x = 10
# y = 3
# print(x < y) Out False

# Equal
# x = 10
# y = 10
# print(x == y)

# Logical Operator == And , Or , And 
# Combine Boolean AND 
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b) # out false

# Combine Boolean OR 
# a = True
# b = False
# print(a or b)  # out true

# Combine Boolean NOT
